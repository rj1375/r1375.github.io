            <p class="card-text">Images have an encoded meaning ready to be decoded. Whether or not the author intended
              any meaning to arise from a creation, humans love to decode. Everything exists within a contextual
              setting. Nothing exists within a vacuum. The image is no exception, especially since we string together
              our sensory input into one collective experience to comprehend.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Similarly, art is set free and goes whatever the wind carries it. By wind, I mean the
              audience or user, and by it, I mean whatever is created and intended for consumption. Unintended
              consequences are the beauty of art. The meaning lies within the eyes of the beholder if you will. The
              author discusses the way in which we gather the fragments of the world's information. About the work, we
              put on ourselves to make sense of the world. We string together bits and pieces of images, text, sounds,
              and other types of sensory input. Then, magically, we experience a second as a collection of things all
              happening in harmony. Unfortunately, that objective viewpoint we think we possess is far from objective.
              We, with all our existing biases and preconceived notions, arrive at the data set presented before us as
              anything but a blank slate. This hardwiring is like the code that is running through the variables of
              life. I got pretty philosophical, but the magic of our senses never ceases to amaze me. </p>
