                    <p class="card-text">The web is a public space. It is a digital world. This mini-world that fits in the back of your pocket feels so personal at times because of how we can access it. Our every step is captured on the web. Every breath we take, every search we click, every move we make is seen even if we are not aware of it. Tim Burners Lee discusses how critical it is to maintain free speech in this world. Democratizing the web and keeping this world free from censorship feels like a Utopia, but at the very least, we must keep this world free from the Dystopia that is just as near.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Bush speaks about the technological gadgets we use today in this utopian way. Strange to step back to 1945 and hear how it felt to experience the radical shift. The exponential curve of innovation pushed scientists to reimagine how they define themselves and how they define the world around us. This Utopia is here; it is UPON US. Even though it technically runs on a series of Laws, known as the Internet Protocols, Lee speaks about the importance of including human rights into the laws of the web. Something so obvious today that was not a huge topic of conversation at the dawn of the web led to the modern-day world we live in. Imagine how different the web could have been if only more conversations were had about human-centric design. As we put ourselves in time, we are right at the turning point of technology. Here in 2021, we can have this self-awareness within the looking glass. We can perceive the future consequences of our actions. We can take control of our futures (for the most part). With this newfound power and self-awareness, we continue to develop faster than ever. Now the focus on creating technology to protect people and maintain human rights is very real. The human experience is fragile and ever-changing. Designing in a human-centric vision leads to a better world not linearly but exponentially.</p>
